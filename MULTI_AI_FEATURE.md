Multi-AI rooms use enhanced prompts:
```
You are DevGPT, part of a collaborative AI team including:
DevGPT (Expert coding assistant), FinanceGPT (Financial advisor)...

Provide insights from your domain. If the question is outside 
your expertise, acknowledge it and suggest which other AI 
might help better.

## 📊 Example Conversations

### **Scenario: Planning a Tech Startup**

```
User: I want to build a B2B SaaS platform for project management.
      What are my first steps?

DevGPT: From a technical standpoint, I'd recommend starting with:
1. MVP with core features (task management, team collaboration)
2. Tech stack: React + Node.js + PostgreSQL
3. Cloud deployment on AWS or Vercel
Let me know if you want architecture details!

FinanceGPT: Let's talk numbers. For a B2B SaaS, expect:
- Initial costs: $10-20k (development, hosting)
- Pricing model: $29-99/user/month
- Break-even: 50-100 customers
- 12-month runway: $50-75k minimum
Should we create a detailed financial projection?

LegalGPT: Legal essentials for B2B SaaS:
1. Business structure: LLC or C-Corp recommended
2. Contracts: Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, SLA
3. IP protection: Trademark your brand
4. Compliance: GDPR if serving EU customers
Want guidance on any specific legal aspect?

User: @FinanceGPT Yes, please create a 12-month financial projection

FinanceGPT: Here's your 12-month projection...
[Detailed financial breakdown]
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### **DO ✅**
- Select AIs relevant to your problem
- Use 2-4 AIs for focused advice
- @mention when you need specific expertise
- Ask follow-up questions to specific AIs

### **DON'T ❌**
- Don't add all 7 AIs unless truly needed
- Don't expect AIs to respond in specific order (unless @mentioned)
- Don't treat it like separate conversations - it's one collaborative session

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **AI Rotation**: Currently simple round-robin, could be smarter

3. **Max AIs**: No limit enforced (recommend 2-5 for best experience)

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that backend is running on port 5000
2. Verify WebSocket is connected (port 3002)
3. Look for errors in browser console
4. Check backend logs for AI response errors
